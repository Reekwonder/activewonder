   <h1 style="text-align:center">Welcome To Government college<br>Pankshin</h1>
   <br>
   <p>How can you tell when you have paid the full price of
success? It’s simple: Look around you. There it is! You
can always tell how much of the price of success you have
paid by looking at your current lifestyle and your bank
account. By the Law of Correspondence, your outer world
will, like a mirror, always reflect the person you are and
the price you have paid on the inside.
There is an interesting point about the price of success:
It must always be paid in full—and in advance. Success,
however you define it, is not like a restaurant where you
pay after you have enjoyed your meal. Instead it is like a
cafeteria, where you can choose whatever you want, but
you must pay for it before you eat it.
Motivational speaker Zig Ziglar says, “The elevator to
success is out of order, but the stairs are always open.”

<h2 style="text-align:center"> OUR STAFFS</h2>
<p>In our society, the top 20 percent of people earn 80 percent
of the money and enjoy 80 percent of the riches and
rewards. This “Pareto Principle” has been proven over
and over again since it was first formulated in 1895 by
Vilfredo Pareto. Your first goal in your career should be
to get into the top 20 percent in your chosen field.
In the twenty-first century, there is a premium on
knowledge and skill. The more knowledge you acquire
and the greater skill that you apply, the more competent
and valuable you become. As you get better at what you
do, your income-earning ability increases—like compound
interest.
NO EXCUSES 23 
Unfortunately, the majority of people—the bottom 80
percent—make little or no effort to upgrade their skills.
Most people, according to Geoffrey Colvin’s 2009 book
Talent Is Overrated, learn their jobs in the first year of
their employment, and then they never get any better. It
is only the top people in every field who are committed
to continuous improvement.
Because of this increasing disparity of productive ability,
based on knowledge, skill, and hard work, the top 1
percent of people in American today control as much as
33 percent of the financial assets.
